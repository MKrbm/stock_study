    - SAA (Strategic Asset Allocation)
      - Strategic asset allocation is a portfolio strategy. The investor sets target allocations for various asset classes and rebalances the portfolio periodically. The portfolio is rebalanced to the original allocations when they deviate significantly from the initial settings due to differing returns from the various assets.

    - TAA (Tactical Asset Allocation)
      - Tactical asset allocation is an active management portfolio strategy that shifts the percentage of assets held in various categories to take advantage of market pricing anomalies or strong market sectors. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tacticalassetallocation.asp)  
    - MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory)
      - The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a practical method for selecting investments in order to maximize their overall returns within an acceptable level of risk. Pioneered by Harry Markowitz. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/modernportfoliotheory.asp)
    - Asset
      - An asset is a resource with economic value that an individual, corporation, or country owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide a future benefit. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp)
    - Commodity 
      - Commodities are basic goods used as inputs in the economy. They are often split into two broad categories: hard and soft commodities. 
      - Hard commodities include natural resources that must be mined or extracted—such as gold, rubber, and oil
      - Soft commodities are agricultural products or livestock—such as corn, wheat, coffee, sugar, soybeans, and pork. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity-market.asp)
    - Commodity Market
      - A commodity market is a marketplace for buying, selling, and trading raw materials or primary products.
      - The major U.S. commodity exchanges are ICE Futures U.S. and the CME Group, which holds four major exchanges: the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the Commodity Exchange, Inc. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commodity-market.asp)
    - Commodities v.s. Other asset classes
      - Commodities are typically negatively correlated with other asset classes. In other words, when stocks and bonds decrease in value, commodities will increase in value, and vice versa. Thus, investing in both is a good diversification strategy. 
    - ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)
      - An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of pooled investment security that operates much like a mutual fund. Typically, ETFs will track a particular index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same way that a regular stock can. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trades on an exchange just like a stock does. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp)
      - The first ETF was the DPFR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), which tracks the S&P 500 Index.
      - ETFs can contain all types of investments, including stocks, commodities, or bonds; some offer U.S.-only holdings, while others are international.
      - ETFs offer low expense ratios and fewer broker commissions than buying the stocks individually. 
    - Mutual Fund
      - A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle consisting of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp)
      - Mutual funds are traded once a day after the market closes.
    - ETF v.s. Mutual Fund
      - They are both composed of multiple types of asset. ETF, as the name "exchange" suggests, can be traded on exchange just like stocks. [source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110314/key-differences-between-etfs-and-mutual-funds.asp)
